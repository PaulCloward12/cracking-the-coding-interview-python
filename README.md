# ðŸ§  Cracking the Coding Interview â€” Python Solutions

This repository contains my Python-based solutions to problems from **_Cracking the Coding Interview_ (6th Edition)** by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

My goal is to master core computer science conceptsâ€”like **data structures, algorithms, Big O notation, recursion, and system design**â€”by solving each problem, writing clean code, and understanding the why behind every solution.

## ðŸ“š What's Included

- **Python Solutions** for each problem (by chapter and number)
- **Unit Tests** using `pytest`
- **Time & Space Complexity** analysis
- **Notes and Diagrams** for deeper understanding
- **Reusable helper classes** (Linked List, Tree, Graph, etc.)


## Complete Random Notes


- Array questions and string questions are often interchangeable.
